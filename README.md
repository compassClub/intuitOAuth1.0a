# Intuit OAuth1.0a
A typescript module that executes the OAuth1.0a protocol and allows an angular2 application to be authorized by, and then make request to a Quickbooks company.
NOTE: This library does NOT work. I have been having a horrible time receiving the error message "signature_invalid". I decided to give up on the project until I realized I could use this really annoying problem to start a website and also get a good grip on using git. I will update my progress to this repo, but you can also follow my progress here https://compassclub.github.io/.
